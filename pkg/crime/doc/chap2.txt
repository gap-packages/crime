  The  calculation  of  group  cohomology  involves  several computations, the

  an object of type [22m[32mCObject[0m, created with the following operation.

  This  function  creates a cohomology object, initially having components the
  p-group G, the field k of characteristic p, and the [1mMeatAxe[0m kG-module M. The
  second  invocation  creates a cohomology object, initially having components
  the p-group G, the field GF(p), and the trivial [1mMeatAxe[0m kG-module.
  
  The cohomology object is used to store, in addition to the group, field, and
  module, the boundary maps, the Betti numbers, the multiplication table, etc.

  [1mReturns:[0m  a list of generators and a list of relators.
  
  Given  a  cohomology  object  [22m[32mC[0m having components G, k, and M, this function
  computes  a  set  of  generators  of the ideal of relators of H*(G,k) having
  multidegree less than or equal to n.
  
  The  function returns two lists, the first containing the variables [22m[32mz[0m, [22m[32my[0m, [22m[32mx[0m,
  ...  corresponding  to  the generators of H*(G,k) if there are fewer than 12

  second is a list of polynomials in the variables from the first list.
  
  These two lists should be interpreted as follows. The degree [22m[32mn[0m truncation of

  1,  1,  and  2,  subject  to  the  relation  zy+y^2.  But  since  H*(G,k) [22m[36mis[0m
  commutative, k being of characteristic 2, we have H*(G,k)=k[z,y,x]/(zy+y^2).
  This   result   can   be   further   improved   by   taking   z=z+y,  giving
  H*(G,k)=k[z,y,x]/(zy).

  [1mReturns:[0m  the cohomology ring of G.
  
  Given  a  cohomology  object [22m[32mC[0m having module component the trivial kG-module
  and  possibly having a projective resolution already computed, this function
  returns  the  degree [22m[32mn[0m truncation of the cohomology ring H*(G,k). The object
  returned is an structure constant algebra.
  
  Users  interested  only  in working with the cohomology ring of a group as a
  [1mGAP[0m  object, and not in calculating generators, relators, induced maps, etc,
  can use the second invocation of this function, which returns the cohomology
  ring   of   the   group   [22m[32mG[0m  immediately,  throwing  away  all  intermediate
  calculations.
  
  Observe   that  the  object  returned  is  a  degree  [22m[32mn[0m  truncation  of  the
  infinite-dimensional   cohomology  ring.  A  consequence  of  this  is  that
  multiplying  two elements whose product has degree greater than [22m[32mn[0m results in
  zero.
  
  Observe  also that calling [22m[32mCohomologyRing[0m a second time with a bigger [22m[32mn[0m does
  [22m[36mnot[0m  extend the previous ring, but rather, recalculates the entire ring from

  think about extending the previous ring the next time I find myself drinking
